             <p class="about-description">I study, develop, live.
                I am mastering the field of IT technology. I am flexible, teachable, ready for criticism and take it from a positive side. I am an optimist, I am interested in the psychology of raising children, relationships, communication and personal development.
                I love when work is completed, when you are paid according to your productivity and you are appreciated as a specialist. Ready to make maximum efforts for effective work and career development.
                My creed: everything that is done, is done for the best.
